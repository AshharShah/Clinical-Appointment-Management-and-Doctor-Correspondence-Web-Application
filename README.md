# ðŸŸ¡ Clinical Appointment Management and Doctor Correspondence Web Application ðŸŸ¡

ðŸ”¸The project is a web based medical care system which deals in connecting patients with doctors around the globe so that they can carry out medical
treatment from the comfort of their home. Not only this but the patient can also check for a disease they may have contracted from just a click of a button due to the symptom checker ability we provide for them.

ðŸ”¸Our product provides multiple functions for our end users. We provide a login and signup function in which a user first creates an account on our platform using his desired credentials.

ðŸ”¸There is also the function for checking the any disease that the user might have developed by exchanging information about the symptoms with the system which would process and find the disease. 

ðŸ”¸We also provide a live chat bot which is accessible by both the doctors and patients as a ground for communication.

ðŸ”¸Furthermore, there is also an appointment booking feature in which a patient can schedule and appointment after which the desired medical professional can respond.
