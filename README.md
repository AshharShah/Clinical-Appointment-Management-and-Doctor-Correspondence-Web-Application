# Clinical-Appointment-Management-and-Doctor-Correspondence-Web-Application
The project is a web based medical care system which deals in connecting patients with doctors around the globe so that they can carry out medical treatment from the comfort of their home. Not only this but the patient can also check for a disease they may have contracted from just a click of a button due to the symptom checker ability we provide for them.

However the project wont work for you since you would need a database with the same data enclosed within the project files that are required for the backend.
